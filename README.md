I'm rarecoil.

Most of the work in this repository is currently outdated, from when I was working in appsec as a penetration tester, and I'm mostly inactive as of 2022. If you want to make changes or issue pull requests, it is likely that there will be significant lag in me reviewing it, if at all. I would recommend forking things you want to use/modify; most everything here is under a permissive license.

Thank you for your interest 🙏
