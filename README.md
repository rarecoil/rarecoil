I'm rarecoil.

**Most of the work here is from when I was working in appsec as a penetration tester.** ~~I'm mostly inactive as of 2022~~. If you want to make changes or issue pull requests, it is likely that there will be significant lag in me reviewing it, if at all. I would recommend forking things you want to use/modify; most everything here is under a permissive license.

Update August 2023: I plan on cleaning up / archiving old and unmaintained stuff here shortly and beginning to use this account more again.
